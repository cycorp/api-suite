 * 
 * http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/threads.html
 *
 * Note that the API changed slightly in the 3rd version:
 * You must now invoke start() on the SwingWorker after
 * creating it.
 * 
 * Note: tbrussea added an event callback wrapper class based
 * on this one, called CycWorker that should be easier to use.
