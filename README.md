Cyc Java API Suite
==================

The Cyc Java API Suite comprises a set of Java APIs (and implementations) for developing Cyc-based
applications or otherwise accessing Cyc capabilities, and provides a layered suite of functionality.
We have currently released the following Java libraries:

* [Core API Specification](core-api-spec/README.md): Core set of APIs for interacting with the Cyc 
  inference engine and knowledge base.
* [Core Client Implementation](core-client/README.md): Reference implementation for the Core API 
  Specification.

Additionally, the [Model Generator Suite](https://github.com/cycorp/model-generator-suite) is 
available in a separate repository.

Further functionality will be rolled out in a series of releases, including the Knowledge 
Management, Natural Language, Structured Knowledge, and Administration APIs:
